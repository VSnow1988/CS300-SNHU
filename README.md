## SNHU CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms : 2022

This class introduced and gave practice in data structures (vectors, lists, binary trees, etc.) and their underlying principles and workings.
We practiced and studied different algorithms for searching sorting, and changing data in these structures as well as time complexity.
